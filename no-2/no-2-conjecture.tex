\section{Introduction}
The \textit{No-2 Conjecture} says that there is no consecutive sequence of ones with a size equal to two in the sequence $T_3$. In other words, no sequence of T translates to a sequence of $T_3$ that has exactly two consecutive ones.\\

Note that this pattern of exactly two consecutive ones does exist in T, but not $T_3$.

\begin{lemma}
The smallest sequence that contains two consecutive ones is 11. To show that the prior and subsequent are not one, we will use the sequence 0110.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
There exists no consecutive sequences of ones or zeros greater than two in T.

E.g. 0110 and 1001 exist in T, but 1110 and 0100 do not.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
Any sequences of T that leads to a sequence of $T_3$ that contains two consecutive ones must have ones in locations 3, and 6.

E.g. . . . 1 . . 1 . . .
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
Any sequences of T that leads to a sequence of $T_3$ that contains two consecutive ones must also have zeros in locations 0, and 9.

E.g. 0 . . 1 . . 1 . . 0
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
The only sequences that translate to a sequence of $T_3$ that are equal to 0110 that follow Lemma 1.2, Theorem 1.2, and Theorem 1.3 are the following. \\

Possible T sequences that translates to $T_3$ equal to 0110 = ['0011001010',
 '0011001100',
 '0011011010',
 '0101001010',
 '0101001100',
 '0101011010',
 '0101101010',
 '0101101100']

\end{corollary}

\begin{lemma} For any sequence of length at most $2^n$, if the Thue-Morse sequence doesn't contain it in the first $2^{n+3}$ digits, it contains it nowhere.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
	None of the sequences from the list of possible T sequences that translates to $T_3$ equal to 0110 are contained in first $2 ^ {9 + 3} = 4096$ digits of T, and therefore exist nowhere in T.
\end{corollary}
